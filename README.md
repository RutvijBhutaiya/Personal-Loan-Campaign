### Setting Up R Studio and Data Variables

Setting up R studio working directory -> Set Working Directory
```
## Set Working Directory

> setwd("C:/Users/server/Desktop/Machine R")
 
## Load MyBank Personal Moan Campaign Data set 

> loan = read.csv('loan.csv')
 
> View(loan)
> attach(loan)

	## Dimensions of data set 
> 
> dim(loan)
[1] 20000    40
```
As we see there are 20000 observations and 40 variables, including independent variable TARGET.

```

In the present data set most of the variables are integer. However, TARGET variable which is independent, represents 0-No and 1-Yes. Yes represents customers have responded positively towards personal loan campaign, and are highly potential customers to apply for personal loan. 
We also observed from the structure of the data represented that, variables FLG_HAS_CC, FLG_HAS_ANY_CHGS, FLG_HAS_NOMINEE and FLG_HAS_OLD_LOAN are factors (either YES or NO). Accordingly, we transferred these variables into factor.
```
#### Convert into Factor class ## 

> loan$FLG_HAS_CC = as.factor(loan$FLG_HAS_CC)

> loan$FLG_HAS_NOMINEE = as.factor(loan$FLG_HAS_NOMINEE)

> loan$FLG_HAS_OLD_LOAN = as.factor(loan$FLG_HAS_OLD_LOAN)

> loan$FLG_HAS_ANY_CHGS = as.factor(loan$FLG_HAS_ANY_CHGS)

```
Before moving forward we’ll take a look on summary. 


Now, before moving forward we are analyzing TARGET variable. 
```
 ## Analyzing TARGER: Independent variable

Based on variables summary table most we recommend removing, 
•	CUST_ID, 
•	TOT_NO_OF_L_TXNS [as reflection of NO_OF_L_CR_TXNS and NO_OF_L_DR_TXNS], 
•	AMT_L_DR [as reflection of AMT_CHQ_DR, AMT_NET_DR and AMT_MOB_DR],
```
 ## MyBank Personal Loan campaign Data set for Descriptive Statistics
> 
> loan = loan[, -c(1,15,27)]
```

<br>

### Descriptive Statistics and Data Preparation 

Under descriptive statistics we’ll start with Histogram and try to find out whether the variable is normal, right skewed or left skewed. 
```
R Studio codes for Histogram are attached in annexure A. 
	> library(ggplot2)
```

<p align="center"><img width=70% src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44467789/63209117-8bb89e80-c0fa-11e9-949c-d6f32018edd1.png>

<br>

Now, as presented in Variables Summary Table we have also checked whether the variable has any significant impact on TARGET variable or not. However, we found that AGE, ACC_OP_DATE, FLG_HAS_NOMINEE, FLG_HAS_OLD_LOAN and random variables do not significantly represent TARGET variable. Hence, we remove the variables from the data set.  

```
## Remove Variables which are NOT Significant to TARGER Variable
> 
> loan = loan [, -c(2,10,35,36,37)]
> 
> dim(loan)

[1] 20000    32
```
Here, we have also removed ACC_OP_DATE, which is reflection of LEN_OF_RLTN_IN_MNTH. 

Now, as we see in Variables Summary Table, we applied BoxCox.Lambda test to normalize the skewed variables. 
```
## Normalize Variable based on skewness
> 
> library(moments)
> library(forecast)
```

In the BoxCox.Lambda test we analyzed that few variables required re-test for normalization. 

<br>

<p align="center"><img width=73% src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44467789/63209166-2dd88680-c0fb-11e9-92fb-161b9b83584b.png>
	
After cleaning and normalizing original data set. New file has been saved as mydata.csv.
```
## Save file as mydata.csv for CART, Random Forest and Neural Networks ML Modeling.
> 
> setwd("C:/Users/server/Desktop/Machine R")

> write.csv(loan, 'mydata.csv')
```

Hence, based on new file mydata.csv we’ll build CART, Random Forest and Neural Networks techniques to build models to predict the response rate of potential bank customers who requires personal loan.

<br>

### CART  Machine Learning Technique - [Link](https://github.com/RutvijBhutaiya/Personal-Loan-Campaign/blob/master/CART%20Technique.R)

To create CART model on mybank personal loan campaign data set, we are using mydata.csv file. 
In mydata.csv data set, first we’ll convert FLG_HAS_CC and FLG_HAS_ANY_CHGS to factor from integer structure. 

```
## Convert into Factor class ##

mydata$TARGET = as.factor(mydata$TARGET)
mydata$FLG_HAS_CC = as.factor(mydata$FLG_HAS_CC)
mydata$FLG_HAS_ANY_CHGS = as.factor(mydata$FLG_HAS_ANY_CHGS)

> class(FLG_HAS_CC)
[1] "factor"

> class(FLG_HAS_ANY_CHGS)
[1] "factor"
```
Now, to create development (training) and testing data set we have split mydaya.csv data file. Where mydata.d represents development dataset with 70% and mydata.t represents testing dataset with 30%. Here both the datasets contains random observations from original dataset, mydata.csv. 

Where, mydata.d represents 14054 observation for development purpose and mydata.t represents 5946 observation for testing dataset. 
Where, 33rd variable is random variable which we created for split. However, random variable does not have any significant impact on model. 

#### Build CART Model 

CART represents Classification and Regression Tree model, and for this model we are using R studio inbuilt library called ‘rpart’.  
Before we begin, we have set control parameters for rpart() function.  

```
## Set Control Parameters 

r.ctrl = rpart.control(minsplit = 100, minbucket = 10, cp = 0, xval = 10)

## Build Classification Tree usinf rpart function

mydata.tree = rpart(formula = TARGET ~ ., data = mydata.d, method = "class", control = r.ctrl)
mydata.tree

fancyRpartPlot(mydata.tree)

```

Parameters from rpart.control() function playa important role in tuning the CART model. 

Higher the minsplit and minbucket would not allow tree to grow fullest. However, very low minbucket does not mean higher accuracy, because very low minbucket, for e.g. minbucket = 2 means we are taking only two observations and prediction the TARGET variable. Hence, accuracy would be higher but only two observations are not sufficient to predict whether customer would respond or not respond. 
Here, in rpart.control() function we are taking minbucket at 15, and minsplit at 80.  

Mydata.tree would not be visible tree to analyze, so we have pruned the tree based on CP parameter.

Now, based on CP table we’ll decide the CP value to prune the tree.
As CP table represents, 13th node represents minimum classification error (xerror) which is 0.96567. Hence, we suggest taking CP value as 0.0028 for pruning the CART tree. 

Pruned classification tree represents splits at each node based on GINI. 
As we can see in the Pruned Classification Tree, at parent node, NO_OF_L_TRXNS <5.5 represents the highest GINI gain and hence rpart() chooses particular variable. 
Also, at NO_OF_L_TRXNS <5.5 node class (0) is dominated with 87% and class (1) responded class is at 13%.

Now, based on mydata.tree.prun, we have predicted the class and probabilities of the class, here class represents 0 and 1, where 0 means Non-Responder and 1 mean Responder. 

```
## For Prediction class do Scoring 

mydata.d$predict.class <- predict(mydata.tree.prun, mydata.d, type = "class")

mydata.d$predict.score <- predict(mydata.tree.prun, mydata.d, type = "prob")
```
Based on the predict() function mydata.tree.prun model be able to show TARGET variable class(0) and class(1, here as table presents predicted class is 0 with 90% probability and at the same observation class(1) with 10% probability. 

Now, to check the CART model performance, first, we are measuring Rank Order method, where we check KS parameter and second we are using confusion matrix. 
To create ran order we have created deciles, and rank order table. 

<p align="center"><img width=83% src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44467789/63266974-b9dedf80-c2ae-11e9-9bfb-4dedfd04e3f0.png>

Rank ordering technique plays significant role to check the performance of mydata.tree.prun model.
In rank ordering table, first we creates deciles, ranging between 1 to 10. Here, cnt_resp and cnt_non_resp represents responded and non-responded customers in particular deciles. In the table variables’ are starting with ‘cum’ means cumulative response for particular deciles. 

In the table, KS is only 0.19 which means model is slightly under fitted. However, cumulative response is 57% for first two deciles. 
Second method we have used to check the performance of the model is confusion matrix. 

In confusion matrix out of 14054 observations, False Positive (Type 1) and False Negative (Type 2) error are 1547 and 95 respectively, with 11.6 % classification error. 

```
## Confusion Martix Error Calculation

with(mydata.d, table(TARGET, predict.class))

dim(mydata.d)

Error = (1633+1577)/14011
Error
# [1] 0.1168

```
Now, have applied CART model to unseen data to mydaya.t data set to check how model performs on the unseen data set. 

<p align="center"><img width=47% src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44467789/63267587-08d94480-c2b0-11e9-924c-1606d990227a.png>
	
To Overcome the under fitness issues of CART model we’ll perform Random Forest technique and check the model fitness.

### Random Forest Machine Learning Technique - [Link](https://github.com/RutvijBhutaiya/Personal-Loan-Campaign/blob/master/Random%20Forest%20Technique.R)

To create CART model on mybank personal loan campaign data set, we are using mydata.csv file. 

Now, to create development (training) and testing data set we have split mydaya.csv data file. Where mydata.d represents development dataset with 70% and mydata.t represents testing dataset with 30%. Here both the datasets contains random observations from original dataset, mydata.csv. 

#### Build Random Forest Model

Random Forest technique is based on ‘Ensemble technique’, where you create multiple trees like forest and the prediction is based on Mode of classification tree, and voting principle will select the class based on Mode. 

Where in CART model we have seen over fitting, RF overcomes overfitting challenge due to n number of trees, where in CART there was only 1 classification tree. 

Random forest model user inbuilt library called randomForest in R studio. 
Parameters in randomforest() function are ntree and ntry; where ntree represents number of classification tree, in RN we are taking 501 such classification trees and based on each 501 trees class, RF prediction would be done based on Mode of each classification tree.

In the function, mtry, represents number of variables to be takes based on boot strap aggregation. And for our study we choose mtry as 15. Mtry is also known as m, which is subset of M (total variables).   

Individual tree strength depends on mtry. Higher the mtry higher the individual tree strength and vice-versa. 
```
## Create Random Forest Model

library(randomForest)

set.seed(123)

mydata.rf <- randomForest(as.factor(TARGET) ~ ., data = mydata.d, 
                      ntree=101, mtry = 10, nodesize = 50,
                      importance=TRUE)
```
OOB (Out f Bag) error represents the number f tree. As we can see from the mydata.rf$err.rate around 20 classification trees are enough to build model. 

Hence, 20 trees - ‘ntree’ parameter in randomforest() function  would be sufficient
Based on the following Error plot,

Based on 20 trees, we have tuned random forest model parameters as shown following, and run the randomforest() function. 
Hence, mtryStart is 15, and for safer side we took ntreeTry as 15, however, best ntreeTry is around 8. 

Here stepFActor we took as 1.2, means in each iteration model will multiply mtreeTry with stepFactor to calculate OOB. Now, when there is improvement of 0.0001 model will switch to higher (m), again OOB be calculated and repeats till significant improvement. 
```
## Based on Error Rate choosing ntree = 15 and Tuning Random Forest Model

rf.tune <- tuneRF(x = mydata.d, 
              y=as.factor(mydata.d$TARGET),
              mtryStart = 8, 
              ntreeTry = 61, 
              stepFactor = 1.2, 
              improve = 0.0001, 
              trace=TRUE, 
              plot = TRUE,
              doBest = TRUE,
              nodesize = 200, 
              importance=TRUE
)

mydata.rf <- randomForest(as.factor(TARGET) ~ ., data = mydata.d, 
                          ntree=15, mtry = 15, nodesize = 200,
                          importance=TRUE)

print(mydata.rf)
```

Error rate is improved slightly 12.29% and class.error for 1 has gone down from 0.989 to 0.976, hence model is improved and fit for 20 trees. 

Now, based on mydata.tree.prun, we have predicted the class and probabilities of the class, here class represents 0 and 1, where 0 means Non-Responder and 1 mean Responder.

Now, to check the Random Forest model performance, first, we are measuring Rank Order method, where we check KS parameter and second we are using confusion matrix. 
To create ran order we have created deciles, and rank order table. 

Based on rank order table in first two deciles response class covers around 70% with 0.52 KS, which is best fit to train dataset.
However, our aim is not to make model best fit to development dataset, but to testing dataset.

Second method we have used to check the performance of the model is confusion matrix. 
Classification error is 0.122, and hence on model accuracy is 87.8%, which we suggest should be more than 90%. 

As we can see from the comparison table that, performance % difference between training and resting is 15%.
